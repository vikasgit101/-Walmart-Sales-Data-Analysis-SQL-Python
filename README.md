## üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmart's point-of-sale transaction data using **advanced SQL queries** and **Python-based data analysis**. It helps uncover trends across branches, payment methods, revenue segments, and customer behavior.

---

## üéØ STAR-Based Summary

**S ‚Äì Situation:**  
Walmart needed insights into sales trends, customer habits, and store performance across its branches.

**T ‚Äì Task:**  
Use SQL to extract KPIs from raw transactional data and Python to visualize those metrics.

**A ‚Äì Action:**  
- Cleaned & formatted raw `.csv` data  
- Queried KPIs using SQL: revenue, ratings, branch performance, payment type  
- Used CTEs and window functions (`RANK()`, `CASE`, `GROUP BY`)  
- Visualized key findings using Python (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`)

**R ‚Äì Result:**  
- Delivered insights on store-level sales, best-selling times, revenue drops  
- Identified top-performing branches, peak hours, and customer feedback trends  
- Built a clear Python+SQL pipeline for business analytics

---

## üìÅ Dataset

- **File:** `orders.csv`  
- **Source:** Simulated Walmart retail transactions  
- **Fields:**  
  - Invoice ID, Date, Time, Branch, City  
  - Customer Type, Product Line, Payment Method  
  - Unit Price, Quantity, Total, Tax, Rating

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Find top branches and product lines by sales  
- Analyze payment method trends  
- Visualize time-based sales behavior (hour/day)  
- Track YoY revenue performance  
- Summarize ratings and customer experience by segment

## üìä KPIs & SQL Logic

- ‚úÖ **Total Revenue per Branch**:
```sql
SELECT Branch, SUM(Total) AS Revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY Branch;
```

- ‚úÖ **Top Product Categories by Quantity Sold**:
```sql
SELECT Product_line, SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Units
FROM orders
GROUP BY Product_line
ORDER BY Total_Units DESC;
```

- ‚úÖ **Payment Method Trends**:
```sql
SELECT Payment, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM orders
GROUP BY Payment;
```

- ‚úÖ **YoY Revenue Drop by Branch** (using CTEs + CASE):
```sql
WITH revenue_by_year AS (
  SELECT Branch, YEAR(date) AS year, SUM(Total) AS revenue
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY Branch, YEAR(date)
)
SELECT 
  Branch,
  ROUND(((MAX(revenue) - MIN(revenue)) / MAX(revenue)) * 100, 2) AS YoY_Drop_Percent
FROM revenue_by_year
GROUP BY Branch;
```
